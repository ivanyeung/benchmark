# Pagecache Fairness Benchmark (C)

This repository contains a focused benchmarking suite to measure **page-cache
performance isolation failures** between co-located tenants — specifically the
**p99 read-latency spike** a latency-sensitive reader (Tenant A) suffers when a
noisy neighbor (Tenant B) shares the page cache.

## 🎯 Purpose

The benchmark exists to validate the two-component model of the p99 spike

```
A's p99 spike = (A's cache-miss rate) × (baseline_read + writeback_queue_delay(B))
```

The experiments isolate the **two interference mechanisms**:

- **Mechanism 1 — eviction only:** B runs a large *clean* sequential scan, fills
  the LRU, and evicts A's hot pages. A re-faults them from disk. No writeback.
- **Mechanism 2 — eviction + dirty writeback:** B runs *buffered writes*, so it
  both evicts A's pages **and** generates dirty pages whose flushes land in the
  I/O queue ahead of A's reads, inflating A's per-miss latency.

The headline result compares A's p99 under Mechanism 1 vs Mechanism 2 **at the
same eviction rate** — if the writer case is worse, that confirms dirty
writeback amplifies the miss penalty beyond what memory sizing alone can fix.

> The old framing ("small sequential workloads win, large random workloads lose")
> is a side effect, not the object of study. Workloads below are organized around
> **victim + noisy-neighbor pairings**, not around a single-workload sweep.

## 📊 Workload Design

Workloads are grouped by the **role** they play in an experiment, not by a
read/write × iodepth grid. Sizes are expressed **relative to the cgroup memory
cap** (`memory.max`, 2G in `cgroup_shared.ini`) rather than as fixed absolutes,
because interference depends on working-set-to-cache ratio.

### Tenant A — the victim (what we measure)

`client1_steady`: 1G `randread`, 4k, rate-limited (`rate_iops=5000`, `numjobs=4`), cached mode. Report clat **p99**. Optional `phase_0_random_distribution = zipf:1.2` skews the hot set so refaults hurt.

### Tenant B — the noisy neighbor

`client2_noisy`: default **Mechanism 2** — 8G `randwrite`, 4k, buffered (`rate_iops=20000`, `numjobs=4`, `iodepth=32`). Edit `phase_0_*` in `[client2_noisy]` for other B behaviors:

| Pattern | bs | Mechanism |
|---------|-----|-----------|
| `read` (sequential) | 1M | **1** — LRU pollution, no writeback |
| `randread` | 4k | **1** — random read pressure |
| `randwrite` | 4k | **2** — eviction + dirty writeback |

### Baselines (Case 1)

| Run | Command | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| A alone | `./benchmark client1_steady` | Flat-p99 reference; Δp99 = (A+B) − this |
| B alone | `./benchmark client2_noisy` | Confirm B sustains its load without A |

## 🔬 Experiment Structure

The unit of experiment is a **dual-client pairing** (`dual` mode), run under the
four isolation conditions from the thesis:

| Condition | Setup | Expected outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline | A alone (`client1_steady`) | p99 flat; cache-hit ≈ 100% |
| Interference | A + B, no isolation | A's p99 spikes; writer B worse than reader B at equal eviction |
| cgroup v2 | A's `memory.low` = WS, no hard cap on B (`cgroup_isolated.ini`) | Partial recovery; residual p99 elevation under writer B |
| Proposed policy | A + B under proposed policy | A's p99 within SLO for both B variants |

**Key comparison:** edit `[client2_noisy]` to `randread` (or sequential `read`) vs `randwrite`, then run `dual` at the **same rate** → does dirty writeback add p99 beyond clean eviction?

**Intensity sweep (Fig 1):** sweep `client2_noisy` `phase_0_rate_iops` (e.g. 1k / 5k / 20k / 50k / unlimited) for read vs write B, plot B intensity (X) vs A p99 (Y).

### Axes that matter (and ones that don't)

- **Block size** is a first-class variable: `bs=1M` sequential = clean scan;
  `bs=4k` random = dirty writes. Do **not** fix everything at 4k.
- **Access distribution** matters: uniform random over a huge file never reuses
  pages, so eviction is free. Use `zipf` for the victim so refaults actually hurt.
- **Buffered vs direct:** writer B must run in **cached** mode — `direct=1`
  generates no dirty page cache and disables Mechanism 2.
- **`numjobs` over `iodepth`** for concurrency: buffered I/O degrades toward
  synchronous, so `iodepth` barely varies true concurrency in cached mode.
  Reserve `iodepth` for the `direct` no-cache baseline.

## 🧪 Experiment Cases (change one variable at a time)

These cases form a **controlled progression**: hold the two tenants
(`client1_steady`, `client2_noisy`), their patterns, runtime, and block size
fixed, and change **exactly one knob per step** so any change in A's p99 or
refault delta is attributable to that knob. Each case is a delta from the one
before it.

| Case | Name | Concurrency | cgroup / memory config | The single variable changed | What it isolates |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Isolated Baselines | Each client **alone** | n/a (no sharing) | — (reference point) | Standalone p99 / throughput per client; the baseline all deltas subtract from |
| 2 | Isolated Clients | Concurrent | `cgroup_isolated.ini` (each client its own memory floor) | +concurrency, **with** isolation | Whether isolation keeps p99 ≈ baseline when both run together |
| 3 | Shared Sequential | Concurrent | **no memory limits** (`--no-cgroup`) | remove cgroup memory limits (shared pool) | Raw interference with nothing protecting A |
| 4 | Shared Client 2 Random Read | Concurrent | shared, parent `memory.max = 512M` | B → 48G file, `randread`, under tiny shared cap | Heavy eviction pressure: B's working set ≫ cache |
| 5 | Shared Client 1 Limited | Concurrent | shared, `client1_steady memory.max = 1G` | cap the **victim's** memory | Whether limiting A (not B) helps or hurts A's p99 |
| 6 | Shared Client 2 Limited | Concurrent | shared, `client2_noisy memory.max = 1G` | cap the **aggressor's** memory | The standard mitigation: does capping B bound A's p99? |

**How to read the progression:**
- **1 → 2:** adds concurrency but keeps isolation → expect A's p99 stays near baseline.
- **2 → 3:** removes the memory limits → expect A's p99 to spike (interference).
- **3 → 4:** makes B a cache-thrashing random reader under a 512M cap → expect
  maximal eviction of A and large `workingset_refault_file_delta` for A.
- **3 → 5** and **3 → 6:** each caps exactly one tenant → compares "limit the
  victim" vs "limit the noisy neighbor" as isolation strategies.

### Running each case

```bash
# Case 1 — Isolated Baselines (run each client on its own, no contention)
./benchmark client1_steady
./benchmark client2_noisy

# Case 2 — Isolated Clients (concurrent, isolated cgroups)
sudo ./benchmark --cgroup-config cgroup_isolated.ini -m cached dual

# Case 3 — Shared Sequential (concurrent, no memory limits)
sudo ./benchmark --no-cgroup -m cached dual

# Cases 4–6 — Shared with one cap changed (edit the cgroup .ini, then run)
sudo ./benchmark --cgroup-config cgroup_shared.ini -m cached dual
```

For Cases 4–6, change the single `memory.max` line in the cgroup config (keep
everything else identical to Case 3's shared layout):

```ini
# Case 4 — parent (shared) cap = 512M, and set client2_noisy file_size = 48G
[clients]
cgroup_name = clients
memory.max = 512M

# Case 5 — cap only the victim
[client1_steady]
memory.max = 1G

# Case 6 — cap only the aggressor
[client2_noisy]
memory.max = 1G
```

> **Strict one-at-a-time note:** Case 4 changes *two* knobs (B's `file_size` →
> 48G **and** the shared cap → 512M). If you want each step to isolate a single
> variable, split it into 4a (file size only) and 4b (add the 512M cap), and run
> them in sequence. Record which knob moved in each run so the p99 / refault
> delta is unambiguously attributable.

Use `-o <dir>` to send each case to its own results directory (e.g.
`-o results/case3_shared`) so `benchmark_analysis.py` can compare them
side by side.

## 🔧 Usage

### Run a Dual-Client Interference Experiment (primary mode)

`dual` mode runs `client1_steady` (Tenant A) and `client2_noisy` (Tenant B)
concurrently under cgroups — this is the experiment that produces the p99 result.

```bash
# Run the A + B pairing in BOTH cached and direct modes
./benchmark dual

# Writer-B interference must run in CACHED mode (direct=1 disables Mechanism 2)
./benchmark -m cached dual

# With a specific cgroup layout
./benchmark --cgroup-config cgroup_shared.ini -m cached dual
```

### Run a Single Client (Case 1 baselines)

```bash
# A alone
sudo ./benchmark --cgroup-config cgroup_isolated.ini -m cached -o results/case1a client1_steady

# B alone (match phase_0_pattern you use in dual: randread or randwrite)
sudo ./benchmark --cgroup-config cgroup_isolated.ini -m cached -o results/case1b client2_noisy
```

### Run Everything

```bash
./benchmark all        # every workload defined in the config
./benchmark -v all     # verbose
```

### Analyze Results
```bash
# Analyze fairness results
./benchmark_analysis.py benchmark_results/
```

## 📈 Understanding Results

### What to look for

The primary signal is **Tenant A's p99 read latency**, compared across
conditions and across B variants:

- **A alone** (`client1_steady`) → p99 flat, near cache-hit latency.
- **A + B (`randread` / sequential `read`)** → p99 rises from eviction/re-faults (Mechanism 1).
- **A + B (`randwrite`)** → p99 rises **further** at the same eviction rate,
  the extra delta attributable to writeback queue contention (Mechanism 2).
- **A + B under cgroup `memory.low`** → partial recovery for the reader B case;
  **residual** elevation for the writer B case = the "existing tools insufficient"
  result.

### Working-set refault deltas (page-cache eviction churn)

`benchmark_analysis.py` now reports per-phase `workingset_refault_file_delta`
per cgroup, read from `memstat/`. This counts file-backed pages a tenant evicted
and had to re-fault from disk during a phase — a direct measure of how much one
tenant's activity churns another's cache.

```
## 🔁 WORKING SET REFAULTS (page-cache eviction churn)
==================================================
### CACHED mode

**client1_steady:**
  phase 2:          300 pages (     1.2 MiB)

**client2_noisy:**
  phase 2:       25,000 pages (    97.7 MiB)

  Refault comparison (client1_steady vs client2_noisy):
    phase 2: client1_steady=300  client2_noisy=25,000  → client2_noisy refaulted 83.3× more
```

## 🔍 Key Metrics

- **p99 / p999 read latency (μs)** — the objective; from fio `clat_ns.percentile`.
  *Lower and flatter under interference = better isolation.*
- **`workingset_refault_file_delta`** — pages re-faulted per phase per cgroup
  (page-cache eviction churn); from `memstat/` (× 4 KiB ≈ bytes re-read).
- **PSI (`some`/`full`, memory + io)** — per-cgroup stall time; from `psi/`.
- **iostat read vs. write latency & queue depth** — surfaces writeback contention.
- **IOPS / BW** — secondary throughput context, not the objective.
- `/proc/vmstat` `nr_dirty` / `nr_writeback` and per-cgroup `file_dirty` at 1s intervals.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `fairness_configs.ini` to modify per-phase parameters:
- `runtime` (seconds), `block_size`, `numjobs`, `iodepth`, `rate_iops`
- `pattern` — `randread` (victim), `read` (clean scan), `randwrite` / `write`
  (dirty B), `randrw` (mixed)
- `file_size` — choose **relative to `memory.max`** (e.g. 0.5× cap for the
  victim's hot set, 2–4× cap for B), not a fixed absolute

Multi-phase configuration format (phase-prefixed keys):
```ini
[client1_steady]                 ; Tenant A — the victim
description = Hot-set random reader; measure p99
file_size = 1G
phase_0_pattern = randread
phase_0_block_size = 4k
phase_0_rate_iops = 5000
phase_0_iodepth = 1
phase_0_numjobs = 4
phase_0_runtime = 60
phase_0_ioengine = libaio

[client2_noisy]                 ; Tenant B — buffered dirty writer (Mechanism 2)
description = Random writer generating dirty writeback
file_size = 8G
phase_0_pattern = randwrite
phase_0_block_size = 4k
phase_0_rate_iops = 20000
phase_0_iodepth = 32
phase_0_numjobs = 4
phase_0_runtime = 60
phase_0_ioengine = libaio
```

> **Reminder:** run writer-B pairings with `-m cached`. In `direct` mode fio
> bypasses the page cache, so B produces no dirty pages and Mechanism 2 vanishes.

### Controlling the victim's hot set (`random_distribution`)

`phase_*_random_distribution` maps to fio's `--random_distribution` and decides
**how the victim's random reads are spread across its file** — i.e. how big and
how hot its working set is. This is the knob that determines whether the shared
cache cap actually causes misses.

| value | effect |
|-------|--------|
| _(unset)_ | uniform — every page equally likely (footprint = whole file) |
| `zipf:1.2` | Zipf skew; concentrates most reads on a small **implicit** hot set (theta higher = more skew). Hot-set size is emergent, not chosen. |
| `zoned:90/20:10/80` | 90% of reads to the first **20%** of the file, 10% to the rest (zone sizes as **percentages**). |
| `zoned_abs:90/200M:10/824M` | same idea, zone sizes as **absolute bytes** — lets you name an exact hot-set size. |

**Reading `zoned_abs:90/200M:10/824M`:** each `pct/size` pair is a zone, laid
out consecutively from offset 0:

```
zoned_abs : 90/200M : 10/824M
              │  │       │  └── next 824 MiB (the cold tail)
              │  │       └───── gets 10% of reads
              │  └───────────── first 200 MiB (the hot set)
              └──────────────── gets 90% of reads
```

So 90% of the victim's random reads keep hitting the same first **200 MiB**
(kept warm in cache), and 10% scatter over the remaining 824 MiB (rarely
resident → usually a miss). `200M + 824M = 1G`, covering the whole file.
`_abs` = absolute sizes; plain `zoned` uses percentages.

**Why it matters — the miss condition.** Frequently re-referenced pages are
LRU-protected, so the victim *keeps* its hot set as long as it fits. Misses
happen only when:

```
hot_set  >  cache the victim can retain  (≈ memory.max − what the aggressor holds)
```

A small hot set (e.g. Zipf's implicit ~50 MiB) fits in any pool and never
misses, so shrinking `memory.max` alone does nothing. Pin a larger explicit hot
set with `zoned_abs` **and** run it against a tight pool so the set can't be
retained. Tuning knobs:

- **first number** (e.g. `90/…`) — access concentration; lower it to spread
  reads out and raise the miss rate.
- **zone size** (e.g. `200M`) — hot-set footprint; grow it until it exceeds the
  victim's retainable cache under contention.

> **Pair with the cap:** `zoned_abs:90/200M:10/824M` only produces misses when
> the pool is smaller than the hot set can be retained in (e.g. `memory.max=512M`
> in `cgroup_shared.ini`). In a 2G pool the 200 MiB fits and the victim just
> hits — grow the hot set or shrink the pool until misses appear.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues
```bash
# sudo is required for cache clearing (drop_caches) and cgroup setup
sudo ./benchmark -m cached dual
```

### Disk Space
```bash
# B files are sized relative to the cache cap (2–4× memory.max).
# Ensure room for the largest test file plus the victim's file.
df -h .
```

### Dependencies
```bash
# Check if tools are installed
which fio gcc make iostat

# Build the benchmark
make
```

## 📊 Example Complete Workflow

```bash
# 1. Build the benchmark
make

# 2. Run the A + B interference experiment in cached mode
sudo ./benchmark --cgroup-config cgroup_shared.ini -m cached dual

# 3. Analyze results (fio p99 + PSI + refault deltas)
./benchmark_analysis.py benchmark_results/

# 4. View summary
cat benchmark_results/summary.txt
```

## 🎯 What This Benchmark Aims to Show

1. A latency-sensitive reader's **p99 spikes** when it shares the page cache
   with a noisy neighbor — even at equal `io.weight` / `cpu.weight`.
2. A **buffered writer** neighbor inflates that p99 **more** than a clean
   scanner at the same eviction rate — the dirty-writeback component.
3. Standard cgroup memory isolation (`memory.low`) **partially** recovers the
   reader-neighbor case but leaves **residual** p99 elevation for the writer
   case — motivating cross-layer (memory ↔ I/O) coordination.

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Custom Configuration
Create or modify `fairness_configs.ini`. For dual-client experiments the two
sections must be named `client1_steady` (Tenant A) and `client2_noisy`
(Tenant B); use phase-prefixed keys for multi-phase runs:
```ini
[client2_noisy]
description = Custom B: mixed random read/write neighbor
file_size = 8G                    ; ~4× the 2G cgroup cap
phase_0_pattern = randrw
phase_0_block_size = 4k
phase_0_rate_iops = 20000
phase_0_numjobs = 4
phase_0_iodepth = 32
phase_0_runtime = 120
phase_0_ioengine = libaio
```

> **Platform note:** cgroups, PSI, and `memory.stat` require **Linux (cgroup v2)**.
> The dual-client interference experiments must run on a Linux host; macOS is
> only useful for building/iterating on the code.

### Command Line Options
```bash
./benchmark --help      # Show help
./benchmark -v all      # Verbose mode
./benchmark -c custom.ini -o results/ workload_name
```

## Repository Status

The benchmark harness is **implemented and runnable on Linux (cgroup v2)**. Experiments are driven by `./benchmark`; operational details and Cases 1–6.

### Layout

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `benchmark.c` | Harness: INI parsing, cgroup setup, fio orchestration, telemetry sampler |
| `Makefile` | `make` → `./benchmark` (`gcc -std=c11`) |
| `fairness_configs.ini` | Workload definitions (victim, noisy neighbor, B variants) |
| `cgroup_isolated.ini` | Per-tenant cgroups; `memory.low` on victim |
| `cgroup_shared.ini` | Shared 2G parent pool; nested tenant cgroups |
| `benchmark_analysis.py` | Summarize fio p99, refault deltas, dirty/vmstat peaks, PSI |
| `benchmark_results/` | Default output directory (`-o` overrides) |

### Harness

- **CLI:** `--config`, `--cgroup-config`, `-o`, `-m cached|direct|both`, `--no-cgroup`, `--no-psi`, `-v`
- **Modes:** `dual` (`client1_steady` + `client2_noisy`), single workload name, `all`
- **Cache:** `drop_caches()` before each cached phase; fio `direct=0` (cached) or `direct=1` (bypass)
- **Test files:** pre-created with `fio --create_only` (`test_file_<client>_<size>`)
- **Concurrency:** all clients in a phase forked together; phases run sequentially
- **fio output:** one JSON per client per phase (`*_pN.json`) with `clat_ns.percentile` (p99/p999)

### cgroups

- Create cgroup tree under `/sys/fs/cgroup`, enable `memory` + `io` controllers
- Apply `memory.max`, `memory.low`, `io.weight` from cgroup INI
- Attach fio via `cgroup.procs` before exec
- Per-phase `memory.stat` snapshots (`workingset_refault_file` before/after → delta in `memstat/`)

### Telemetry (1 Hz during each mode run)

- **iostat:** `iostat -dx 1` → `iostat/run_<mode>.iostat`
- **PSI:** per-cgroup `memory.pressure` + `io.pressure` → `psi/<cgroup>_<mode>.csv`
- **vmstat:** `nr_dirty`, `nr_writeback`, `pgpgin`, `pgscan_kswapd` → `dirty/vmstat_<mode>.csv`
- **Per-cgroup dirty:** `file_dirty`, `file_writeback` → `dirty/<cgroup>_<mode>_dirty.csv`

Requires `--cgroup-config` for per-tenant memstat/PSI/dirty (not recorded with `--no-cgroup`).

### Workloads (`fairness_configs.ini`)

| Section | Role |
|---------|------|
| `client1_steady` | Tenant A — rate-limited `randread`; victim in `dual`; run alone for Case 1a |
| `client2_noisy` | Tenant B — default `randwrite`; noisy neighbor in `dual`; edit `phase_0_*` for Mechanism 1 vs 2; run alone for Case 1b |

Phase keys: `pattern`, `block_size`, `iodepth`, `numjobs`, `rate_iops`, `runtime`, `ioengine`, `rwmixread`, `random_distribution` (e.g. `zipf:1.2`), `fdatasync`, `fsync`.

### Quick start

```bash
make
sudo ./benchmark --cgroup-config cgroup_shared.ini -m cached dual
./benchmark_analysis.py benchmark_results/
